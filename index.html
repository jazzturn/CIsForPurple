    <h2><span class="purple-words hide-show">(Hide)</span> Instructions</h2>
    <p>Test and sharpen your perfect or relative pitch with just two buttons!</p>
    <p>Hit the <b>SPACE BAR</b> to begin playing. If you think you hear a "C"(as in the musical note C), click the <b class="purple-words">PURPLE BUTTON</b>. If you hear any note other than C, click the <b class="red-words">RED BUTTON</b>.</p>
    <p>Guess correctly and watch your points go up. If not, lose them. You won't be penalized for not guessing at all!</p>
    <p>If you're feeling overwhelmed by the loss of points (as we all do sometimes...*insert sad face*), press the <b>SPACE BAR</b> to pause the game (<b>SPACE BAR</b> twice to reset your score...but again, it's no biggie).</p>
