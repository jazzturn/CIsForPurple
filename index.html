    <h1>C Is For Purple</h1>
    <h2><span>(Hide)</span> Instructions</h2>
    <p>Test and sharpen your perfect or relative pitch with just two buttons!</p>
    <p>Hit the SPACE BAR to begin playing. If you think you hear a "C"(as in the musical note C), click the PURPLE button. If you hear any note other than C, click the RED button.</p>
    <p>Guess correctly and watch your points accumulate. If not, lose them. You won't be penalized for not guessing at all!</p>
    <p>If you're feeling overwhelmed by the loss of points(as we all do sometimes...*insert sad face*), press the SPACE BAR to pause the game (SPACE BAR twice to reset your score...but again, it's no biggie).</p>
